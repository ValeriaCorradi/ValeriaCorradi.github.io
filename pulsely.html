      <h3>overview</h3>

      <div class="paragraph24">
        <p>For this project, I had the opportunity to <strong>design and develop</strong> a comprehensive, user-centric
          website for Pulsely, a leading platform specializing in diversity and inclusion analytics. The project focused
          on creating a visually compelling and functionally robust website that effectively communicates Pulsely’s
          mission.</p>
        <p>Built using <strong>Webflow</strong>, the website delivers an intuitive user experience, optimized for
          accessibility and performance across all devices, positioning Pulsely as a trusted leader in workplace
          inclusion solutions.</p>

        <p>As the <strong>UI designer and Webflow developer</strong> on this project, my primary responsibilities
          included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Conducing thorough <strong>research</strong> into Pulsely’s brand identity, target audience, and
              competitors to inform design decisions</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Developing <strong>interactive prototypes</strong> to visualize and refine the user journey</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Collaborating</strong> with Pulsely stakeholders to gather feedback, iterate designs, and align
              with their vision</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Ensuring compliance with <strong>accessibility</strong> standards, optimizing for inclusivity and
              performance</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Implementing the pages in <strong>Webflow</strong> translating designs into a fully functional website

      <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>

      <div class="paragraph24">
        <h4>Conveying Complexity Simply</h4>
        <p>Successfully tackling the technical challenge of transferring all Figma prototypes to Webflow required a
          strategic approach.
          </br>To tackle this, we used clear, concise language, visual hierarchies, and intuitive navigation to make
          complex information <strong>easy to understand</strong>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph24">
        <h4>Streamlining Figma to Webflow</h4>
        <p>Given the nature of <strong>e-commerces</strong>, it was essential to convey details in a straightforward
          manner.
          </br>I utilized the <strong>'Figma to Webflow' plugin</strong>, which streamlined the process significantly.
          </br>Additionally, I leveraged <strong>libraries</strong> such as 'Untitled UI' to enhance the design elements
          and ensure a seamless transition.
          </br>This experience not only honed my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of using advanced
          tools to achieve professional-grade results.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph24">
        <h4>Responsive and Inclusive Design</h4>
        <p>Ensuring the website looked great and functioned well <strong>across all devices</strong> was another
          challenge.
          </br>I addressed this by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Implementing a <strong>mobile-first</strong> design approach</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Creating <strong>flexible layouts</strong> that adapt to different screen sizes</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Optimizing</strong> images and elements for faster loading on mobile devices</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Creating a website that embodies Pulsely’s <strong>commitment to diversity</strong> by being accessible to
          users of varying
          abilities and backgrounds was a must.
          </br>I approached this by adopting inclusive design principles, incorporating accessibility guidelines in
          the design.</p>

          <p></br>Working with Valeria was a great experience!
            </br>We collaborated mainly on designing and building a new version of our website, and she supported us
            every
            step of the way: from ideation to implementation in Webflow. Valeria consistently went above and beyond our
            expectations, and whenever we ran into challenges, she always found smart, effective solutions.
            </br>You’ll be in great hands with her!</p>
